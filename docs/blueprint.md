## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep burgundy (#800020) to bring a sophisticated, rich tone to buttons and highlights.
- Background color: Soft off-white (#FAFAF9) to maintain a light, airy feel throughout the site.
- Accent color: Soft violet (#800080) for secondary interactive elements.
- Headline Font: 'Playfair', serif. It should be applied to headlines to provide a fashionable high-end feel.
- Body Font: 'PT Sans', sans-serif. This font is meant for use in all body text. Pairing this with Playfair produces a high-contrast, classic, elegant aesthetic.
- Grid-based layout: Implement a clean grid layout with sufficient whitespace to improve content presentation and visual hierarchy, optimizing user navigation and experience.
- Use subtle transition effects to add polish without overwhelming the minimalist style.
